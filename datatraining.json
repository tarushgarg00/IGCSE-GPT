    "Questions": "What distinguishes economic goods from free goods?",
    "Answers": "Economic goods are scarce in relation to demand, making them valuable. They often come with a price tag that results in profit for the suppliers. Examples include oil, corn, and gold. Free goods, on the other hand, are abundant in supply, and it is normally not possible to make a profit from supplying such goods due to this abundance. Examples include sunlight, sea water, and the air we breathe."

  {
    "Questions": "What is the importance of identifying dynamic changes in markets as mentioned in the provided tip?",
    "Answers": "Identifying dynamic changes in markets allows us to understand the consequences and pinpoint the new equilibrium point after a change in the market."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What condition results from an increase in the supply of an item?",
    "Answers": "When the supply of an item increases, a condition of excess supply or surplus exists."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Can you summarize the systematic process to build an explanation of a dynamic change in the market?",
    "Answers": "The process involves identifying the change in demand or supply, stating the new direction of the curve, indicating the disequilibrium at the original price, mentioning whether sellers raise or lower prices, explaining the contraction or extension of demand and supply, stating new equilibrium points and finally, explaining the market outcome."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What does the law of demand state?",
    "Answers": "The law of demand states that when there is an increase in price, there will be a fall in the quantity demanded."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What does Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) measure?",
    "Answers": "PED measures how responsive the change in quantity demanded is to a change in price."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How is PED calculated?",
    "Answers": "PED is calculated using the formula (change in quantity demanded / change in price)."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What example is used in the text to calculate the price elasticity of demand (PED)?",
    "Answers": "The text uses the example of a firm that raises the price of its products from £10 to £15, which causes its sales to fall from 100 to 40 units per day."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How is the value of PED interpreted in Economics?",
    "Answers": "In Economics, the value of PED is always negative, but economists ignore the negative sign and present the answer as a positive number."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are the possible values and labels for PED?",
    "Answers": "PED values can range from 0 to infinity, with labels including Perfectly Inelastic (0), Relatively Inelastic (0-1), Unitary Elasticity (1), and Relatively Elastic (1 to infinity)."

  {
    "Questions": "What effect did Hurricane Fiona have on Puerto Rico's crop of plantains in September 2022?",
    "Answers": "The hurricane caused much damage to the crop resulting in a supply shock, and thereby a decrease in supply of plantains causing the prices to go up."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What was the original market clearing price of plantains in Puerto Rico before Hurricane Fiona struck?",
    "Answers": "The text does not provide explicit information regarding the original market clearing price of plantains in Puerto Rico before Hurricane Fiona struck."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What does the symbol ∞ represent in the context of price elasticity of demand (PED)?",
    "Answers": "Ans.1. The symbol ∞ (infinity) represents a state of perfect elasticity where any increase in price will result in the quantity demanded falling to zero. This is a highly theoretical situation, not often encountered in reality."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are some determinants of PED?",
    "Answers": "Ans.2. Some determinants of PED include availability of substitutes, addictiveness of the product, the price of the product as a proportion of income, and the time period considered."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Explain how the availability of substitutes impacts price elasticity?",
    "Answers": "Ans.3. Greater availability of substitutes leads to a higher value of PED, making the demand for a product or service relatively elastic. This is because consumers can easily switch to substitutes if the price of the original product increases."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does the addictiveness of a product affect its PED?",
    "Answers": "Ans.4. Addictiveness turns products into necessities result in a low value of PED, making the demand relatively inelastic. Consumers will still buy the required amount of such products even if the price increases."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Explain the concept of the total revenue rule.",
    "Answers": "Ans.5. The total revenue rule states that to maximise revenue, firms should increase prices for inelastic goods and decrease prices for elastic goods. This is because a price increase for an inelastic good will not significantly decrease its quantity demanded, and a price decrease for an elastic good will greatly increase its quantity demanded."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does the time period impact the elasticity of a product?",
    "Answers": "Ans.6. In the short term, consumers are less responsive to price increases, resulting in a low value of PED (relatively inelastic). Over a longer time period, consumers may become more price sensitive and look for substitutes, resulting in a higher value of PED (relatively elastic)."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does price elasticity influence firms' revenue strategies?",
    "Answers": "Ans.7. If a product is price inelastic in demand, firms should raise their prices to increase total revenue. If a product is price elastic in demand, firms should lower their prices, as this will lead to a more than proportional increase in quantity demanded, thereby raising total revenue."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How do governments use knowledge of PED in taxation and subsidies?",
    "Answers": "Ans.8. Governments can tax products that are price inelastic in demand to raise tax revenue without causing significant harm to firms or reducing quantity demanded significantly. Additionally, they can subsidize products that are price elastic in demand to stimulate a more than proportional increase in quantity demanded."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is price elasticity of supply (PES) and how is it calculated?",
    "Answers": "Ans.9. Price elasticity of supply (PES) reveals how responsive a change in quantity supplied is to a price change. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How do firms respond to price increases according to the law of supply?",
    "Answers": "Ans.10. According to the law of supply, when there is an increase in price, producers will increase the quantity supplied, and vice versa."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What does a PED value of less than 1 indicate?",
    "Answers": "Ans.11. A PED value of less than 1 indicates that the product or service is price inelastic. This means the quantity demanded will change less proportionally in response to a change in price."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "In the worked example, did the firm make the correct decision by raising the price of its products from £10 to £15?",
    "Answers": "Ans.12. According to the example, the firm did not make the correct decision. When they increased the price, their total revenue fell, indicating that the product was price elastic in demand. They should have lowered prices to maximise revenue."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Explain what is meant by price discrimination?",
    "Answers": "Ans.13. Price discrimination refers to a pricing strategy where firms charge different prices to different segments of consumers for the same product or service, typically based on their willingness to pay."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does the price of a product as a proportion of income affect PED?",
    "Answers": "Ans.14. The smaller the proportion of income the price of a product represents, the less responsive consumers are to price changes, resulting in a lower PED value and making the demand for the product relatively inelastic."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What happens to the demand of a good or service when it is price elastic in demand?",
    "Answers": "Ans.15. When a good or service is price elastic in demand, there is a greater than proportional increase in the quantity demanded due to a decrease in price."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is the relationship between the elasticity of demand and total revenue?",
    "Answers": "Ans.16. If a product has elastic demand, total revenue increases when price decreases. If a product has inelastic demand, total revenue increases when price increases."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What does a common error students make regarding price inelastic goods?",
    "Answers": "Ans.17. A common error is assuming that when prices increase for inelastic goods, the quantity demanded does not decrease. It does decrease, but to a less than proportional extent."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What does the calculation formula PES = %ΔQS/%ΔP mean?",
    "Answers": "Ans.18. This formula calculates the Price Elasticity of Supply (PES). It describes the percentage change in Quantity Supplied (%ΔQS) for each percentage change in Price (%ΔP)."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How did the Bewdley Farm Shop maximise their profits for avocados?",
    "Answers": "Ans.19. Bewdley Farm Shop increased the quantity supplied of avocados to the market in response to a price rise, thereby maximising their profits."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Do governments commonly tax demerit goods like cigarettes?",
    "Answers": "Ans.20. Yes, governments often increase taxes on demerit goods like cigarettes because the increase in price leads to a less than proportional decrease in quantity demanded, which allows governments to raise tax revenue while simultaneously discouraging consumption."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What does the PES value of 0.15 indicate?",
    "Answers": "The PES value of 0.15 indicates that avocados are very price inelastic in supply. That means, even with a significant increase in price, suppliers are unable to supply more, likely due to the time it takes to grow additional avocados."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "From which range of values do PES vary?",
    "Answers": "The Values of PES Vary From 0 To Infinity."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is a perfectly inelastic PES?",
    "Answers": "A perfectly inelastic PES (PES = 0) is when the quantity supplied is completely unresponsive to a change in price, for instance, the fixed number of seats in a theatre."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How can firms increase their PES?",
    "Answers": "Firms can increase their PES by creating more spare capacity on their production lines, maintaining larger inventories, and using more modern technology."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is the impact of having a low PES?",
    "Answers": "If producers have a low PES (inelastic), they are less able to respond to increases in price. This shortage in supply will mean that prices continue to rise, possibly causing inflation in the economy."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does the PES of housing affect the economy?",
    "Answers": "If the PES of housing is low (inelastic), property prices will become unaffordable with any increase in demand."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is a market economy?",
    "Answers": "A market economy is an economy that has no government intervention in the allocation of resources and distribution of goods/services. This is also called a free market economy."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is the determinant of economy type?",
    "Answers": "The type of economy is determined by how the three economic questions are answered which ultimately determines the amount of government intervention in an economy."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Which economies are considered to have less government intervention?",
    "Answers": "The United States, Japan & Singapore are mixed economies but have less government intervention than Norway, Germany or China."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What freedoms are central to a market economy?",
    "Answers": "In a market economy, individuals have the right to purchase the factors of production, start their own business, decide who they are going to work for and decide what goods/services best meet their wants/needs."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What role does the price mechanism play in a market economy?",
    "Answers": "In a market economy, changes in prices allocate scarce resources. Rising prices indicate a shortage of resources and falling prices indicate a surplus of resources."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are some advantages of a market economy?",
    "Answers": "Some advantages of a market economy include greater variety of goods/services, competition leading to better quality goods/services, and motivation to work or develop entrepreneurial ideas through profit incentive."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are some disadvantages of a market economy?",
    "Answers": "Some disadvantages of a market economy include wealth concentration, increasing inequality, exploitation of workers, resource depletion, and the development of monopolies."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is market failure?",
    "Answers": "Market failure occurs when the price mechanism fails to allocate scarce resources efficiently. It is characteristic of a free market."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What happens when a product has a relatively elastic PES?",
    "Answers": "When a product has a relatively elastic PES (1 to infinity), the percentage change in quantity supplied is more than the percentage change in price. For example, the supply of t-shirts may change significantly with a small change in price."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Why is time period one of the determinants of PES?",
    "Answers": "Time period is a determinant of PES because in the short run, producers may find it harder to respond to an increase in prices as it takes time to produce the product. However, in the long run they can change any of their factors of production so as to produce more."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is the significance of PES for stakeholders?",
    "Answers": "The PES is significant for stakeholders because it indicates how responsive producers are to price changes. If producers have a high PES, they can respond to price increases quickly, increasing revenues & profits."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does PES affect the labor market?",
    "Answers": "If the PES of labor is low (inelastic) then production costs of firms will rise quickly during periods of increasing demand when firms need to hire additional workers."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is unitary elasticity?",
    "Answers": "Unitary elasticity is a situation where any supply curve that starts at the origin (e.g. S1, S2 or S3) has a PES value equal to 1. This means the percentage change in price equals the percentage change in quantity supplied."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does the availability of raw materials affect PES?",
    "Answers": "If raw materials are scarce then PES will be low (inelastic). If they are abundant, PES will be higher (elastic). This is because with more raw materials, production can be increased more readily."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are scarce resources?",
    "Answers": "Scarce resources are the factors of production, including land, labour, capital, and enterprise."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is a market failure?",
    "Answers": "Market failure is a situation where free market activity results in an allocation of resources that is less than optimum from the perspective of society."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is an example of a demerit good?",
    "Answers": "Examples of demerit goods include cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs. These are goods that are harmful and are over-consumed due to over-allocation of resources."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Can you explain the concept of private, social, and external costs?",
    "Answers": "Private costs are the expenses incurred by the producer or consumer directly. External costs are the additional costs borne by third parties not involved in the transaction, such as environmental damage caused by production. Social cost is the sum of private and external costs."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are external benefits?",
    "Answers": "External benefits are the advantages gained by third parties not directly involved in an economic transaction. For instance, bees from a bee farm may pollinate nearby apple orchards, offering additional, unintended benefits."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Can you provide an example of a merit good?",
    "Answers": "Merit goods are those that are beneficial to society but under-consumed. Examples include vaccinations, education, and electric cars."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How can market failure result in inequality?",
    "Answers": "Market failure can lead to inequality when the market causes a lack of equity, with the rich getting richer and the poor getting relatively poorer."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is factor immobility?",
    "Answers": "Factor immobility occurs when it is difficult for factors of production to move or switch between different uses or locations."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are some common methods to address market failure?",
    "Answers": "Common methods to address market failure include indirect taxation, subsidies, maximum prices, and minimum prices. Other methods include regulation, nationalisation, privatisation, and state provision of public goods."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is a positive externality of consumption?",
    "Answers": "A positive externality of consumption occurs when a benefit is received by a third party as a result of a consumption activity. For example, when electric vehicles are consumed, CO2 emissions fall."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is a negative externality of production?",
    "Answers": "A negative externality of production occurs when there is an external cost in production, such as when the production of electricity increases air pollution."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are public goods?",
    "Answers": "Public goods are beneficial to society but would be under-provided by a free market as they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous in consumption. Examples include national defense, parks, libraries, and lighthouses."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Can you define external costs?",
    "Answers": "External costs arise when the social costs of an economic transaction are greater than the private costs. Damage not accounted for in the market transaction, like littering, is considered an external cost."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What does non-excludability refer to?",
    "Answers": "Non-excludability refers to the inability of private firms to prevent certain customers from using their products; for example, everyone benefits from street lighting, regardless of whether they personally paid for it or not."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What does non-rivalry indicate?",
    "Answers": "Non-rivalry indicates that the product cannot be used up, so there is no competitive rivalry in consumption to drive up prices and generate profits for firms."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is the definition of social cost?",
    "Answers": "Social cost is the sum of private and external costs. It reflects the true cost of an economic transaction."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is a monopoly power?",
    "Answers": "Monopoly power is held by a single company that dominates the entire market, resulting in less competition, higher prices, limited choice, and under-provision of goods/services."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does a merit good differ from a public good?",
    "Answers": "Merit goods are beneficial but often under-consumed because consumers may not fully realize their benefits. Public goods, on the other hand, are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, beneficial to all and would be under-provided in a free market."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does factor immobility affect the market?",
    "Answers": "Factor immobility can lead to inefficient allocation of resources in the market, usually under-provision and can limit economic growth."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How is the pricing mechanism related to external costs and benefits?",
    "Answers": "The pricing mechanism in a free market often tends to ignore these externalities. If external costs and benefits were factored in, the price and output in the market would be different."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is a maximum price, and when might a government use it?",
    "Answers": "A maximum price is set by the government below the existing free market equilibrium price, and sellers cannot legally sell the good/service at a higher price. Governments often use maximum prices to help consumers, either as a long-term measure in areas such as housing rental markets or as short-term solutions to disruptively high prices, for example, in the petroleum market."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are the advantages of using maximum prices?",
    "Answers": "The main advantages are that it allows some consumers to benefit from lower prices and can stabilize markets in the short term during periods of extreme disruption."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What disadvantages might arise from the use of maximum prices?",
    "Answers": "The use of maximum prices can lead to shortages, causing some consumers to be unable to make a purchase. It might also encourage the creation of illegal markets. Furthermore, maximum prices distort market forces and can thus lead to inefficient allocation of resources."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is a minimum price, and what purpose does it serve?",
    "Answers": "A minimum price is set by the government above the existing free market equilibrium price, and sellers cannot legally sell their goods/service for less. Governments often set minimum prices to help producers or decrease the consumption of demerit goods like alcohol."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are the advantages of using minimum prices?",
    "Answers": "Producers, particularly in agricultural markets, can benefit from minimum prices as they receive a higher price for their goods. Also, this method can help reduce external costs as producers usually lower their output to match demand at the minimum price."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are the disadvantages of using minimum prices?",
    "Answers": "The use of minimum prices can lead to increases in government expenditure due to the purchase and storage or export of excess supply. Over time, farmers may become overly reliant on government support, and potential unemployment may increase in the industry."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How are minimum prices used in labor markets?",
    "Answers": "In the labor market, minimum prices are used in the form of a National Minimum Wage (NMW). This is a legally imposed wage rate set above the market rate that employers are obligated to pay their workers."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a minimum wage in labor markets?",
    "Answers": "The major advantages include guaranteeing a minimum income for lowest paid workers, stimulating consumption in the economy, and incentivizing workers to be more productive. Disadvantages include increased costs for firms, which can lead to layoffs, higher prices, or both."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is an indirect tax?",
    "Answers": "An indirect tax is paid upon the consumption of goods/services. It is typically levied by the government on demerit goods to reduce demand and/or raise government revenue."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does an indirect tax affect producers and consumers?",
    "Answers": "Indirect taxes are levied on producers, leading to a shift in the supply curve. Producers and consumers each pay a share of the tax. The end impact on both parties depends on the price elasticity of demand for the product in question."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are the benefits of indirect taxes?",
    "Answers": "Indirect taxes can reduce the quantity demanded of demerit goods and provide revenue for government programs."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are the downsides of indirect taxes?",
    "Answers": "The effectiveness of indirect taxes in reducing the use of demerit goods depends on the price elasticity of demand. They can fuel illegal markets and cause producers to lay off workers if demand falls significantly due to the higher prices."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How is the price elasticity of a product related to tax incidence?",
    "Answers": "The price elasticity of a product influences who absorbs more of the tax cost — the consumer or the producer. The more price inelastic the product, the greater the proportion of the tax will be passed on to consumers. Conversely, the more price elastic the product, the smaller the proportion of the tax will be passed on to consumers."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is a producer subsidy?",
    "Answers": "A producer subsidy is a per unit amount of money given to a firm by the government."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How do maximum prices affect market equilibrium?",
    "Answers": "The imposition of a maximum price below the initial equilibrium price creates a condition of excess demand, as it increases the incentive to consume and reduces the incentive to supply."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How do minimum prices influence market equilibrium?",
    "Answers": "The imposition of a minimum price above the free market equilibrium price creates a condition of excess supply as it increases the incentive to supply and decreases the incentive to consume."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does a national minimum wage affect the labor market equilibrium?",
    "Answers": "The imposition of a national minimum wage above the market wage rate increases the supply of labor due to higher wages but decreases the demand for labor by firms, causing potential unemployment."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does an indirect tax affect market equilibrium?",
    "Answers": "The imposition of an indirect tax shifts the supply curve to the left, increasing the price consumers pay and decreasing the price producers receive. The quantity demanded in the market also decreases."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Why might governments prefer combined methods of intervention rather than a single method?",
    "Answers": "Using multiple methods of intervention can be more effective, as different strategies can address different aspects of a problem. For example, smoking is not only taxed but also subject to heavy regulations to simultaneously reduce consumption and increase public health awareness."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How do consumer responsiveness and market segments factor into the effectiveness of interventions like taxes?",
    "Answers": "Different market segments have different reactions to interventions such as taxes. Wealthy consumers will be less responsive (inelastic demand) to tax increases than poorer consumers (elastic demand), influencing the impact and effectiveness of such interventions."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does a subsidy help increase production?",
    "Answers": "A subsidy helps increase production by shifting the supply curve from S to S + subsidy. This increases the quantity demanded in the market and leads to a lower price and higher quantity demanded in the market."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Who benefits from subsidies and how?",
    "Answers": "Both consumers and producers benefit from subsidies. Consumers receive a part of the subsidy in the form of lower prices while producers receive part of the subsidy directly from the government, leading to increased revenue."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of producer subsidies?",
    "Answers": "Advantages include targeting help to specific industries, lowering prices and increasing demand for merit goods, and changing destructive consumer behaviour. Disadvantages include distorting market resources, the opportunity cost associated with government expenditure, and susceptibility to political pressure and lobbying."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What alternative methods does the government use to address market failure?",
    "Answers": "The government uses various methods including state provision of public goods, privatization, nationalization, and regulation to address market failure."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is meant by the term 'public goods'?",
    "Answers": "Public goods are beneficial for society and are not provided by private firms due to the free rider problem. They are usually provided free at the point of consumption and are accessible to everyone."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does the government use privatization to address market failure?",
    "Answers": "Through privatization, governments transfer ownership and control of firms from the public sector to the private sector. This encourages more competition and efficiency resulting in lower prices."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is the rationale behind the process of nationalization?",
    "Answers": "Nationalization occurs when the Government takes control and ownership of firms from the private sector. It can generate efficiencies and creates more equity in society as all citizens have the same access to the resource at the same price."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does the government regulate markets?",
    "Answers": "The government creates rules to limit harm from the external costs of consumption or production. Regulatory agencies are often created to ensure that these rules are followed."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is a mixed economic system?",
    "Answers": "A mixed economic system is a blend of a market and planned economy where individuals, firms and the government own factors of production and distribute goods and services. In reality, almost every country in the world operates as a mixed economic system."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Why is government intervention necessary in economic systems?",
    "Answers": "Government intervention is necessary to correct market failure, earn government revenue, promote equity, support firms, support poorer households, and provide essential services."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does government intervention seek to support poorer households?",
    "Answers": "Government intervention seeks to support poorer households by redistributing income, meaning taxing the rich and providing for the poor. This helps to reduce the impact of poverty."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are some ways the government raises revenue?",
    "Answers": "The government raises revenue through various forms of intervention including taxation, privatisation, sale of licenses and the sale of goods/services."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is the meaning of money in an economic context?",
    "Answers": "Money in an economic context refers to a medium of exchange that individuals and firms use for trade. Prior to the creation of money, barter systems were used where goods and services were exchanged directly for other goods and services."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does behavior change as a consequence of producer subsidies?",
    "Answers": "Producer subsidies can help change destructive consumer behavior over a longer period of time by making certain goods, such as electric cars, more affordable for the masses."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How do subsidies lead to market distortions?",
    "Answers": "Subsidies can distort the allocation of resources in markets, leading often to excess supply when used in certain sectors, such as agriculture."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is an opportunity cost in relation to government expenditure on subsidies?",
    "Answers": "The opportunity cost associated with government expenditure on subsidies refers to the other potential uses for that money that are forgone when the government decides to spend it on subsidies."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are the key characteristics of a planned economy?",
    "Answers": "In a planned economy, the government has a high level of intervention and control over the factors of production and the distribution of goods and services."

  },
  {
    "Questions": "What factors result in price inelastic demand & supply?",
    "Answers": "Wage determination in highly skilled markets, like NBA basketball players, is price inelastic in both supply and demand. This is because clubs want the very best players, almost no matter the cost, and a significant increase in price will have a little impact on the quantity of labour supplied, given it takes years to develop such skills."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does price elastic demand & supply work in the labour market?",
    "Answers": "Wage determination in unskilled markets, such as on a building site, is price elastic in both supply and demand. If wages dropped a bit, firms would respond quickly by recruiting more workers. Likewise, due to being unskilled roles, an increase in wages would quickly lead to an increase in labour supply."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What influences a worker's bargaining power?",

  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does the imposition of a national minimum wage affect the labour market?",
    "Answers": "When a national minimum wage is imposed above the market wage rate, the supply of labour, incentivised by higher wages, increases. However, facing higher production costs, the demand for labour by firms decreases, leading to a potential for unemployment."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Do national minimum wages always increase unemployment?",
    "Answers": "No, several studies have shown that unemployment does not necessarily increase - and can sometimes decrease - with the introduction of national minimum wages. This can occur if workers, now earning higher wages, choose to consume more, thus driving up total demand in the economy, and subsequently, the demand for labour from firms."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are some reasons for wage differences?",
    "Answers": "Wage differentials can be due to a number of factors, including gender, the industry sector, public vs private sector, and the level of skill and experience of the worker."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Why is there often a wage differential between men and women?",
    "Answers": "Men typically work full-time whereas women often work part-time, usually due to childcare demands. Women also often take breaks in their career progression due to family matters, and are more likely to accept a job below their skill level if it fits in with their family needs. All these factors contribute to the gender wage gap."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Why do sector workers in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors receive different wages?",
    "Answers": "Workers in the primary sector usually receive lower wages due to the unskilled nature of the work. Workers in the secondary and tertiary sectors often have higher levels of education and specialised skills, which commands higher wages."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How do the private and public sectors differ in terms of pay?",
    "Answers": "Wage differentials between the private and public sectors can be due to numerous factors, such as the level of risk associated with the job, the size of the organisation, the level of competition in the market, and the specific skills and qualifications required for the position."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does skill level affect pay differences?",
    "Answers": "Skilled workers tend to receive higher wages than unskilled workers. This is largely due to the higher levels of education, training, and experience required for skilled roles, which are often more demanding and require greater responsibility than unskilled roles. Skilled workers also tend to have more bargaining power due to their unique qualifications and the demand for their specialised skills."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What sector typically generates the lowest profits in the production chain?",
    "Answers": "The primary sector, which deals with raw materials, often generates the lowest profits in a production chain."
  },

Public sector wages often reach a maximum ceiling below what the private sector may offer, but they also seldom fall as low as some private sector jobs."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Why are the wages for skilled workers higher than unskilled workers?",
    "Answers": "Becoming skilled requires time and money, leading to a limited supply of specific skillsets. Because of these factors, wages for skilled workers are generally higher as employers recognize these factors."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is the 'division of labour' according to Adam Smith?",
    "Answers": "The division of labour, as considered by Adam Smith, is when a task is broken up into several component parts, allowing workers to specialize and gain significant skill in these parts. This, in turn, leads to higher productivity and output."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does specialization occur?",
    "Answers": "Specialization can occur at several different levels - individual, business, regional, and global. It means that entities focus on producing specific goods or providing specific services they are most efficient at."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is a trade union, and what are its functions?",

  {
    "Questions": "Which policy increases interest rates: expansionary or contractionary?",
    "Answers": "Contractionary policy is associated with increase in interest rates."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is the outcome if the Central Bank increases interest rates?",
    "Answers": "If the Central Bank increases interest rates, existing loan repayments for households become more expensive which reduces discretionary income, decreases consumption, and as a result total demand falls."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What effects does reducing interest rates have on the economy?",
    "Answers": "Lowering interest rates can stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper, thus encourage spending and investment."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does quantitative easing stimulate the economy?",
    "Answers": "Quantitative easing increases the supply of money in the economy, allowing more capital for investors which in turn stimulates spending and investment."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What happens to the level of exports and imports when the value of currency appreciates?",
    "Answers": "When the value of currency appreciates, it makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, which can reduce exports and increase imports."

  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does a contractionary monetary policy affect household consumption?",
    "Answers": "A contractionary monetary policy can decrease household consumption, because if the policy increases interest rates, discretionary income reduces, and as a result consumption decreases."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How can the Central Bank influence the exchange rate?",
    "Answers": "The Central Bank can influence the exchange rate through buying or selling its own currency."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are the potential economic consequences of depreciating the local currency?",

  },
  {
    "Questions": "What occurs when hot money flows increase in an economy?",
    "Answers": "When hot money flows increase, the exchange rate appreciates making exports more expensive and imports cheaper. This results in a reduction in net exports, and therefore, the total demand decreases."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What is the effect of increased hot money flows on macroeconomic aims such as economic growth, inflation, unemployment, and the current account?",
    "Answers": "An increase in hot money flows may slow down economic growth, ease inflation, increase unemployment (since output is falling and fewer workers are required), and likely worsen the current account as both exports and imports decrease."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Can you give an example of the impact of expansionary monetary policy?",
    "Answers": "An example would be the USA Federal Reserve Bank committing to $60bn a month of QE.

This subsequently increases consumption, investment, and total demand."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are the benefits of monetary policy?",
    "Answers": "Monetary policy, such as that exercised by the Bank of England, operates independently from the government and considers the long-term outlook. It helps target inflation and maintain stable prices. Moreover, depreciating the currency can help increase exports."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are the disadvantages of monetary policy?",
    "Answers": "Monetary policy may have conflicting goals, such as economic growth causing upward pressure on inflation due to lower rates. There can also be time lags of up to 2 years between policy implementation and its desired impact. Its effectiveness may falter if firms and consumers do not respond to lower interest rates due to low confidence, and it can inflate asset prices in the long term."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Can you define a supply-side policy?",
    "Answers": "A supply-side policy aims to increase the total supply or productive potential of the economy. This is achieved by boosting the quality or quantity of production factors, effectively causing an outward shift of the productive possibility curve."

  },
  {
    "Questions": "What effect can lower direct taxes have on an economy?",
    "Answers": "When the government reduces taxes, workers' incentive to work harder increases because they get to keep more of their earnings. This also provides firms with extra funds that they can invest in new technology or machinery, boosting their productivity and the broader economy."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What does deregulation mean in economic terms?",
    "Answers": "Deregulation is the process of removing government controls and laws from markets in order to increase competition."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How does any regulation impact the costs of production for firms?",
    "Answers": "Regulation often increases the costs of production for firms as they have to meet additional requirements, spending more on labor, technologies, and measures that ensure compliance."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What are some potential benefits of restructuring the unemployment benefits system?",

  },
  {
    "Questions": "How can the private sector contribute to an increase in supply in an economy?",
    "Answers": "The private sector can increase supply in the economy as they are incentivised to increase their profits, which often involves expanding production and developing new products or services."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How is economic growth defined?",
    "Answers": "Economic growth is defined as the annual increase in the level of national output as measured by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How is GDP calculated using the value of expenditure in an economy?",
    "Answers": "GDP is calculated as the sum of Consumption (C), Investment (I), Government spending (G), and the difference between Exports (X) and Imports (M). Thus GDP = C + I + G + (X-M)."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What indicates likely economic growth in terms of GDP components?",
    "Answers": "If any component of GDP – consumption, investment, government spending, or net exports – increases, it usually indicates likely economic growth."

    "Questions": "How does each component's value and contribution to GDP vary?",
    "Answers": "Each component's value and its contribution to GDP can vary significantly depending on the country. For example, government spending contributes 53% to Sweden's GDP, whereas in the UK, it contributes 25% to the GDP."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "How is real GDP different from nominal GDP?",
    "Answers": "Nominal GDP is the actual value of all goods/services produced in an economy in a one-year period, with no adjustment for inflation. Meanwhile, real GDP is the value of all goods/services produced in an economy in a one-year period adjusted for inflation."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What happens to real GDP if nominal GDP is £100bn and inflation is 10%?",
    "Answers": "If nominal GDP is £100bn and inflation is 10%, then real GDP would be £90bn after adjusting for inflation."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Can you explain what GDP per capita is and what it demonstrates?",
    "Answers": "GDP per capita is calculated as the GDP divided by the population. It shows the mean wealth of each citizen in a country and makes it easier to compare standards of living between countries."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Can you give an example of GDP per capita?",
    "Answers": "Yes, for instance, Switzerland has a much higher GDP per capita than Burundi, illustrating a higher average wealth and standard of living in Switzerland."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What can cause economic growth?",
    "Answers": "Actual economic growth occurs when there is an increase in the quantity of goods/services produced in an economy during a given period of time. This is often measured by the percentage change in real GDP."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "What would have a larger impact on economic growth, a 1% increase in consumption or a 1% increase in net exports?",
    "Answers": "A 1% increase in consumption or government spending would have a larger impact on economic growth than a 1% increase in net exports."
  },
